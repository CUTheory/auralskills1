For Monday's class, read the new resource on [protonotation](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/protonotation.html). Then find an 8â€“12 measure passage of music that is 1) in compound meter and 2) in minor with some raised *la*s and *ti*s. Rewrite that melody in protonotation and bring both the original and the protonotation transcription to class.

Bring Kazez and Berkowitz to class on Monday.

If you had difficulty recognizing the keyboard schemata in class, spend some additional time before Monday playing through them and memorizing the sound of each schema.
