Wednesday, Sept. 25, will be the Cycle I listening quiz. It will contain the following items, and you will be allowed the number of listenings indicated below for each example:

- solf√®ge patterns (2 hearings each, first and last pitch provided)  
- interval ID (2 hearings each)  
- triad ID (2 hearings each)  
- rhythmic dictation (4 hearings, with count-off for the meter)  
- melodic dictation (5 hearings, with a key-establishing cadence and count-off for the meter)

To prepare for this quiz, please review your labs and practice any areas that you struggled with (either lots of wrong answers, or too many listenings to get the correct ones). Interval and triad ID are most easily practiced on teoria.com. For melodic dictation, you can use the recorded melodies provided in the **MUSI 1121 shared materials** folder on Google Drive. There are no count-offs or key-establishing cadences, so you may want to provide yourself an extra hearing to get oriented. I have a key for these melodies, so you can stop by my office to review your progress.
