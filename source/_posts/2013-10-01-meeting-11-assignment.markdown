For *Friday, Oct. 4, 8am*, record a video of yourself singing melody #82 (Berkowitz, p. 21). Prepare and practice it as best you can, using a keyboard if possible, before recording. Don't sweat it if it's not perfect, but get it as solid as you can.

Bring Berkowitz and plenty of staff paper to class on Monday.
