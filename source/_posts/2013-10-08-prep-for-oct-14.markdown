For Monday, October 14, please review the [cadence playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/kris.shaffer/playlist/7H2g6Bv8rN6HwlGolcaL9H) from class. Listen to the first phrase of each track again. For those discussed in class, you know what type of cadences they are; review the sound of those cadences. For those we didn't get to, identify the first cadence you hear, write down the timing and the cadence type (HC/PAC/IAC), and bring to class.

Also, please bring staff paper, species counterpoint exemplars, and Berkowitz to class on Monday.
