In advance of our next meeting (Wednesday, Aug. 28), practice the [major-key melodic sequentials](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicSequentials.html) introduced in class. (There will be a video performance of these sequentials, along with some rhythmic exercises, due on Sept. 3.)

Sign up for [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com), [Learning Catalytics](http://www.learningcatalytics.com), and [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com) (if you haven't already).

Please make use of Piazza, rather than emailing me directly, if you have any questions about the course, the syllabus, the policies, the homework, or the technology.
