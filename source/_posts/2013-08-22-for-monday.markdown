Welcome (back) to Boulder! 

Before our first meeting, please read the [syllabus][syl] and [policies][pol] pages for this course, as well as the [Unit I guide][unit1]. Note any questions you have about these documents.

Also, please bring a web-enabled device to class—such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop—and your copy of Kazez, *Rhythm Reading*, and Berkowitz, *A New Approach to Sight Singing*. 

I look forward to meeting all of you on Monday!
