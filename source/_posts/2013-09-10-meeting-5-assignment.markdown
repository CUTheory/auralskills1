*For Thursday, Sept. 12, 9am*, please do the following:

- Do [lab assignment 1.2](http://www.colorado.edu/music/courses/musc1121/1_2/index.html) (both the worksheet and audio files can be found at that page).  

Please bring the completed worksheet by my office (slide it under the door if I'm not around), or take a picture of your completed worksheet and email it to me. Bring the original to class on Monday.

***Before submitting your assignment, please re-affirm the honor code in writing somewhere on the worksheet:***

> I hereby reaffirm the CU honor code. [sign your name]

Or, simply,

> IHRTCUHC. [sign your name]

Also, note that this lab will be graded on accuracy (see syllabus). Based on lab 1.1, that should not be a problem, and it will give you a good idea where you stand in advance of Quiz 1 (Sept. 23). (See Cycle I guide for updated schedule.)

Some additional resources may be helpful for you, depending on the state of your understanding of these concepts from written theory. Consult them, as needed. You may consult any informational resources (unless, of course, you happen to come across an answer key) while working on the lab assignment (including re-watching the video), but you may not consult another person as you work out the answers.

- [Intervals and dyads](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/Intervals.html)  
- [Triads and seventh chords](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/triads.html)  
- Clendinning & Marvin (your written theory textbook), Chapters 6 ("Intervals") and 7 ("Triads")

(My resources are about a third as long as Clendinning/Marvin.)

*Please be sure to bring both the Berkowitz anthology and staff paper to class on Monday.*
