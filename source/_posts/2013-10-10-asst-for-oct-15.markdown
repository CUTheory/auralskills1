For *9am, Tuesday, Oct. 15*, do [Lab 2.2](http://www.colorado.edu/music/courses/musc1121/2_2/index.html). Drop it by my office or send me a picture/scan of your completed lab by then.

On Wednesday, we will do a little singing and a lot of dictation practice. Bring species and canon exercises to class, along with staff paper and a pencil. You do not need Berkowitz or Kazez.
