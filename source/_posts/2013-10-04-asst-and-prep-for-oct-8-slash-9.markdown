For *Tuesday, Oct. 8, 9am*, do [Lab 2.1](http://www.colorado.edu/music/courses/musc1121/2_1/index.html) (skipping the section on cadences).  Please slide it under my office door (N138) or email me a picture/scan of it by 9am.  

Before Wednesday's class (Oct. 9), read the resource on [Classical cadence types](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/cadenceTypes.html). Don't worry about the weird chord notation. For now, when you see **D5**, think **V<sup>(7)</sup>**, and when you see **T1**, think **I**.
