Monday, October 21, is recitation no. 2. Be sure to sign up for a time with a partner and prepare the materials distributed in class.

Wednesday, October 23, will be the listening quiz for Unit II. Recitation preparation will be your best prep for the listening quiz, along with practicing intervals and triads on teoria. I will post additional materials for cadences and dictation practice later in the week.
