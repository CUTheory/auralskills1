*Due to technical difficulties, we're going to have to scrap Lab 1.1 (for now). Please **disregard** the original Meeting 3 assignment. (I have deleted it in order to reduce confusion.) If necessary, we will push back the Cycle I quiz and/or recitation.*

**For Monday, Sept. 9:**

Go to [teoria.com](http://teoria.com), and click on Exercises ["for mobile devices"](https://www.teoria.com/mobile/index.php). (Be sure to use the mobile exercises, so you can view/share your score without paying for an account!) The first category is *Ear Training*. Use both the [Intervals](https://www.teoria.com/mobile/intervals/ie.php?l=en) and [Triads](https://www.teoria.com/mobile/triads/c3e.php?l=en) modules.

First, practice both interval and triad recognition until you feel pretty solid. If you are struggling with the intervals, set some limits as you practice. When you first click on "Intervals Ear Training," you see a bunch of check boxes for interval types. By unchecking some of these, you can focus on a subsetâ€”just seconds and thirds, for example.

If intervals are difficult or new for you, focus on just seconds and thirds, then just fourths and fifths, then thirds and sixths, etc., and finally put them all together once you are comfortable with them in smaller groups.

Once you are starting to get the hang of interval and chord recognition, quiz yourself. Give yourself 10 intervals, and then click "End exercise and view score." Repeat this 10-intervals/chords-at-a-time quiz until you get at least 8 correct. Once you "pass" with 8/10 or better, take a screenshot of your result and email it to me. Be sure to reaffirm the honor code in your email. ("I hereby reaffirm the CU Honor Code" or "IHRTCUHC.")

If you are having trouble and are unable to reach "passing" by Sunday, or are simply spending way too much time trying to get there (more than 30 minutes/day), stop by my office or send me an email describing the specific things that are causing you difficulty.

By Monday, you should send me both *passing interval quiz results* and *passing chord quiz results*, or an email in lieu of one (or both) describing your attempts and your difficulties. If you have any questions about this, please email me ASAP or post on Piazza.

Please bring your Berkowitz anthologies to class on Monday.

Sorry again about the mixup! We'll get the website fixed/replaced soon.
