Monday, October 21, is recitation no. 2. Be sure to sign up for a time with a partner and prepare the materials distributed in class.

Wednesday, October 23, will be the listening quiz for Unit II. Recitation preparation will be your best prep for the listening quiz, along with practicing intervals and triads on teoria. I will post additional materials for cadences and dictation practice later in the week.

UPDATE: I have added two-part dictation exercises to the MUSC 1121 Shared Resources folder on Google Drive. See the PDF in that folder for key, meter, and length information.
