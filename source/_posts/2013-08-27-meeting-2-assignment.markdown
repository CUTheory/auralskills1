For *Tuesday, Sept. 3, 8am*, please do the following:

- Read this very short resource on [Meter and time signatures](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/meter.html). (It should be review for most of you.)  
- Record a video of yourself performing all seven [major-key melodic sequentials](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicSequentials.html). Upload to Google Drive, and share with me. (Feel free to record each sequential one at a time and either splice the videos together or upload multiple files into a single folder, if necessary.)  
- Record a video of yourself performing rhythmic exercises **TBA** from the Kazez, with appropriate rhythmic syllables. Upload to GDrive, and share with me.
- Also make a 1â€“2 minute video introducing yourself: Who are you? Where are you from? What are your goals? (in life, and in this class) This will help me get to know you better.

A 1-minute video domonstrating uploading and sharing files on Google Drive can be found [here](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/GDrive.html). If you have any difficulties, please make use of Piazza to ask questions of me and/or your classmates. CU officially supports GDrive, so the student help desk should also be able to help.

Have a great Labor Day weekend! (In order to enjoy it fully, I highly recommend you complete as much of this assignment as possible by Friday.)
