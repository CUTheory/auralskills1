I will be away on Wednesday for a conference. During class time on Wednesday, please get together and either as a whole group or in multiple smaller groups, work on the following assignment. At the end of class, please write a 1â€“2 sentence email to me explaining what you did/accomplished during class time.

Assignment due *Monday, Nov. 4, 8am*:

- Choose three of the following rhythmic exercises from Kazez: nos. 70, 73, 76, 83, or 88.

- Choose three of the five melodies on the [Recitation 3 guide](media/rec3.pdf).

- Practice them until you have mastered them, and record a video of yourself performing each of the six exercises flawlessly, or nearly so.

- Create a new folder in Google Drive, upload your videos (clearly labeled in the file name) to that folder, and share it with me before Monday's class.

- Bring Berkowitz, Kazez, and staff paper to class on Monday.
