*If* you did not pass (receive a check mark) on either your interval or triad ID portions of Quiz 1, go to [teoria.com](http://teoria.com), and click on Exercises ["for mobile devices"](https://www.teoria.com/mobile/index.php). (Be sure to use the mobile exercises, so you can view/share your score without paying for an account!) Practice [Intervals](https://www.teoria.com/mobile/intervals/ie.php?l=en) and/or [Triads](https://www.teoria.com/mobile/triads/c3e.php?l=en), according to what you need to practice. When you think you are up to where you need to be or have made significant progress, take a fresh pass through 10 or so examples, take a screenshot of your result, and send it to me.

Note that if you did not pass those sections on your quiz, *this is not an optional assignment*. Those who did pass those sections are welcome to do extra practice, of course. Interval and triad ID will be on the Unit II labs and quiz.

Bring Berkowitz and Kazez to class again on Wednesday.
