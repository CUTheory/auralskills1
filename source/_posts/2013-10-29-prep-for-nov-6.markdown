For Wednesday's class, play through the [Keyboard voice-leading schemata]({{ root_url }}/media/KBschemata-practiceHandout.pdf) distributed in class. As you play, try to "chunk" these schemata; that is, try to get to the point where you can recognize them as individual patterns, rather than two or three differerent chords put together.

As you play, also try to come up with an explanation for the names assigned to each schema or set of schemata.

Bring the schemata handout and staff paper to class on Wednesday. You will not need Berkowitz or Kazez.
