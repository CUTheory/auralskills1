All prepared performance videos are due **8am, Friday, Nov. 22**. The only new ones should be the Cycle 4 materials (see the [Assessment]({{ root_url }}/assessment/) guide for links) if you have kept up with the homework assignments.

There is no required prep work for after break (Dec. 2), but keep an eye on this website and your email for instructions on what to bring to class.

Have a great break!
