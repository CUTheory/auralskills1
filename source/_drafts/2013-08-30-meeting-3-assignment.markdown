*For Friday, Sept. 6, 8am*, please do the following:

- Read/watch my resource on [melodic dictation](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicDictationDemo.html).  
- Do [lab assignment 1.1](http://www.colorado.edu/music/courses/musc1121/1_1/index.html) (both the worksheet and audio files can be found at that page).  

Please *watch the video first*, as it will help with the lab assignment. Also note the due date/time. I want to look at the results as I plan for Monday's class, so we can make best use of our time, and I need them submitted early to do that. Please bring the completed worksheet by my office (slide it under the door if I'm not around), or take a picture of your completed worksheet and email it to me. Bring the original to class on Monday.

***Before submitting your assignment, please re-affirm the honor code in writing somewhere on the worksheet:***

> I hereby reaffirm the CU honor code. [sign your name]

Or, simply,

> IHRTCUHC. [sign your name]

Also, note that this lab will be graded on completeness, not accuracy (see syllabus). It will give us a baseline from which to work as we focus our efforts on the greatest problem areas (and prepare for subsequent, higher-stakes assignments).

Some additional resources may be helpful for you, depending on the state of your understanding of these concepts from written theory. Consult them, as needed. You may consult any informational resources (unless, of course, you happen to come across an answer key) while working on the lab assignment (including re-watching the video), but you may not consult another person as you work out the answers.

- [Triads and seventh chords](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/triads.html)  
- Clendinning & Marvin (your written theory textbook), Chapters 6 ("Intervals") and 7 ("Triads")

(My resources are about a third as long as Clendinning/Marvin.)
