Students will be evaluated according to the following ten categories:

- Rhythmic prepared performance  
- Rhythmic sight-singing  
- Melodic prepared performance  
- Melodic sight-singing  
- Keyboard prepared performance  
- Rhythmic dictation  
- Melodic dictation  
- Harmonic dictation  
- Cycle 1 & 2 performance  
- Professionalism & participation

For each category, students will receive a running assessment of **N** (not passed—yet), **B** (borderline), or **P** (passing). At the end of the semester, a final score will be tallied with Ps equalling 1 point, Bs 0.5 points, and Ns 0 points. A total of 9 or better will translate into an A, 8 or better B, 7 or better C, 6 or better D, less than 6 F. 

Following are passing standards for each category.

## Rhythmic prepared performance  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to perform (with preparation) rhythmic excerpts containing rhythmic values down to the subdivision (no syncopation) in simple or compound meter. This will be demonstrated with a video portfolio of exercises from the Kazez book chosen by the instructor. This portfolio should include three excercises from Chapter 3 (chosen by the student from nos. 70, 73, 76, 83, and 88) and three exercises from Chapter 4 (chosen by the student from nos. 107,m 109, 111, 113, and 115).


## Rhythmic sight-singing  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to perform (from sight) rhythmic excerpts containing rhythmic values down to the subdivision (no syncopation or dotted rhythms) in simple or compound meter. This will be demonstrated in a sight-singing examination involving rhythms similar in length and difficulty to exercises in Kazez, Chapters 1–2.


## Melodic prepared performance  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to perform (with preparation) melodies in simple and compound meter, in major and in minor, composed of stepwise motion, some leaps, and arpeggios of standard triads and the V<sup>(7)</sup> chord. This will be demonstrated in a video portfolio of melodies taken from the guides for [Recitation 3]({{ root_url }}/media/rec3.pdf) and [Recitation 4]({{ root_url }}/media/rec4.pdf): students will select three melodies from each to include in their portfolio, which can be submitted via Google Drive at any time.


## Melodic sight-singing  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to perform (from sight) melodies in simple and compound meter, in major and in minor, composed of stepwise motion, some leaps, and arpeggios of the tonic triad and the V<sup>(7)</sup> chord. This will be demonstrated in a sight-singing examination involving melodies similar in length and difficulty to the prepared melodies of Recitations 1 and 2.


## Keyboard prepared performance  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to perform any diatonic triad or seventh chord in a phrase-length (8–12 chords), basso-continuo-style keyboard passage. This will be demonstrated with a video portfolio of exercises chosen by the instructor.


## Rhythmic dictation  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to dictate, after 4 hearings, the rhythm of a melody that meets the criteria of rhythmic prepared performance above.


## Melodic dictation  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to dictate, after 5 hearings, the rhythm of a melody that meets the criteria of melodic prepared performance above.



## Harmonic dictation  

Passing this category requires demonstrating an ability to dictate, after 5 hearings, the outer voices and most likely harmonic functions of a keyboard-style progression that meets the criteria of keyboard prepared performance above.


## Cycle 1 & 2 performance  

Passing this category requires an overall grade of A or B at the end of Unit II. Borderline requires a grade of C at the end of Unit II.


## Professionalism & participation

Passing this category requires the same level of participation, assignment completion, and attendance as in Units I and II.
