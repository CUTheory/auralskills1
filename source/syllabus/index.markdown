# Course description #

MUSC 1121 is the first course in the four-semester sequence of basic ear training and sight-singing required of all music majors. This class and its corequisite, MUSC 1101 (first semester theory), are designed to develop musical skills required of all literate musicians. We will focus on aural recognition and performance of rhythms and melodies, recognition of harmonic progressions, general improvment of sight singing skills, and a bit of melodic and harmonic keyboard facility, as well. These skills all contribute to our general musicianship and to our ability to pre-hear, conceptualize, and learn music in particular.

This class is structured in four-week cycles, each incorporating in-class drill, lab assignments, a dictation quiz, and an individual performance recitation (including keyboard).

*Important*: Makeup quizzes and recitations will generally not be given, nor will late lab assignments be accepted.

# Grading #

Students will be evaluated according to the following ten categories:

- Rhythmic prepared performance  
- Rhythmic sight-singing  
- Melodic prepared performance  
- Melodic sight-singing  
- Keyboard prepared performance  
- Rhythmic dictation  
- Melodic dictation  
- Harmonic dictation  
- Cycle 1 & 2 performance  
- Professionalism & participation

For each category, students will receive a running assessment of **N** (not passed—yet), **B** (borderline), or **P** (passing). At the end of the semester, a final score will be tallied with Ps equalling 1 point, Bs 0.5 points, and Ns 0 points. A total of 9 or better will translate into an A, 8 or better B, 7 or better C, 6 or better D, less than 6 F. Passing standards for each category are provided on the [assessment]({{ root_url }}/assessment/) page.

# Attendance #

*Please be responsible* about your attendance and your work. Since this is a skills class, practice is necessary for success. Absences and lates will lower your *professionalism and participation* grade, and we are required to notify the undergraduate dean when a student exceeds three absences. Notify your instructor in advance about date(s) when you know you will be away (for events such as performances, auditions, etc.). If you miss a class due to a legitimate emergency, let your instructor know—before your absence, if possible, but certainly as soon as you return to class. Consult your instructor if you are having trouble meeting the expectations of the class. We are here to help you in the gradual and sometimes trying work of improving your aural skills. Have a successful and fulfilling semester!
