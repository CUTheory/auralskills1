    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>For Thursday, Sept. 12, 9am</em>, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/music/courses/musc1121/1_2/index.html">lab assignment 1.2</a> (both the worksheet and audio files can be found at that page).</li>
</ul>


<p>Please bring the completed worksheet by my office (slide it under the door if I&#8217;m not around), or take a picture of your completed worksheet and email it to me. Bring the original to class on Monday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Before submitting your assignment, please re-affirm the honor code in writing somewhere on the worksheet:</em></strong></p>

<blockquote><p>I hereby reaffirm the CU honor code. [sign your name]</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, simply,</p>

<blockquote><p>IHRTCUHC. [sign your name]</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, note that this lab will be graded on accuracy (see syllabus). Based on lab 1.1, that should not be a problem, and it will give you a good idea where you stand in advance of Quiz 1 (Sept. 23). (See Cycle I guide for updated schedule.)</p>

<p>Some additional resources may be helpful for you, depending on the state of your understanding of these concepts from written theory. Consult them, as needed. You may consult any informational resources (unless, of course, you happen to come across an answer key) while working on the lab assignment (including re-watching the video), but you may not consult another person as you work out the answers.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/Intervals.html">Intervals and dyads</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/triads.html">Triads and seventh chords</a></li>
<li>Clendinning &amp; Marvin (your written theory textbook), Chapters 6 (&#8220;Intervals&#8221;) and 7 (&#8220;Triads&#8221;)</li>
</ul>


<p>(My resources are about a third as long as Clendinning/Marvin.)</p>

<p><em>Please be sure to bring both the Berkowitz anthology and staff paper to class on Monday.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>For Tuesday, Sept. 10, 8am</em>, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read/watch my resource on <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicDictationDemo.html">melodic dictation</a>.</li>
<li>Do <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/music/courses/musc1121/1_1/index.html">lab assignment 1.1</a> (both the worksheet and audio files can be found at that page).</li>
</ul>


<p>Please <em>watch the video first</em>, as it will help with the lab assignment. Also note the due date/time. I want to look at the results as I plan for Monday&#8217;s class, so we can make best use of our time, and I need them submitted early to do that. Please bring the completed worksheet by my office (slide it under the door if I&#8217;m not around), or take a picture of your completed worksheet and email it to me. Bring the original to class on Monday.</p>

<p>Or, simply,</p>

<blockquote><p>IHRTCUHC. [sign your name]</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, note that this lab will be graded on completeness, not accuracy (see syllabus). It will give us a baseline from which to work as we focus our efforts on the greatest problem areas (and prepare for subsequent, higher-stakes assignments).</p>

    <link href="http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/2013/09/new-meeting-3-assignment/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-05T08:37:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/2013/09/new-meeting-3-assignment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Due to technical difficulties, we&#8217;re going to have to scrap Lab 1.1 (for now). Please <strong>disregard</strong> the original Meeting 3 assignment. (I have deleted it in order to reduce confusion.) If necessary, we will push back the Cycle I quiz and/or recitation.</em></p>

<p><strong>For Monday, Sept. 9:</strong></p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://teoria.com">teoria.com</a>, and click on Exercises <a href="https://www.teoria.com/mobile/index.php">&#8220;for mobile devices&#8221;</a>. (Be sure to use the mobile exercises, so you can view/share your score without paying for an account!) The first category is <em>Ear Training</em>. Use both the <a href="https://www.teoria.com/mobile/intervals/ie.php?l=en">Intervals</a> and <a href="https://www.teoria.com/mobile/triads/c3e.php?l=en">Triads</a> modules.</p>

<p>First, practice both interval and triad recognition (root-position triads only: major, minor, diminished, and augmented) until you feel pretty solid. If you are struggling with the intervals, set some limits as you practice. When you first click on &#8220;Intervals Ear Training,&#8221; you see a bunch of check boxes for interval types. By unchecking some of these, you can focus on a subsetâ€”just seconds and thirds, for example.</p>

<p><img src="http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/images/IntervalPracticeLimits.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If intervals are difficult or new for you, focus on just seconds and thirds, then just fourths and fifths, then thirds and sixths, etc., and finally put them all together once you are comfortable with them in smaller groups.</p>

<p>Once you are starting to get the hang of interval and chord recognition, quiz yourself. Give yourself 10 intervals, and then click &#8220;End exercise and view score.&#8221; Repeat this 10-intervals/chords-at-a-time quiz until you get at least 8 correct. Once you &#8220;pass&#8221; with 8/10 or better, take a screenshot of your result and email it to me. Be sure to reaffirm the honor code in your email. (&#8220;I hereby reaffirm the CU Honor Code&#8221; or &#8220;IHRTCUHC.&#8221;)</p>

<p>If you are having trouble and are unable to reach &#8220;passing&#8221; by Sunday, or are simply spending way too much time trying to get there (more than 30 minutes/day), stop by my office or send me an email describing the specific things that are causing you difficulty.</p>

<p>By Monday, you should send me both <em>passing interval quiz results</em> and <em>passing chord quiz results</em>, or an email in lieu of one (or both) describing your attempts and your difficulties. If you have any questions about this, please email me ASAP or post on Piazza.</p>

<p>Please bring your Berkowitz anthologies to class on Monday.</p>

<p>Sorry again about the mixup! We&#8217;ll get the website fixed/replaced soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For <em>Tuesday, Sept. 3, 8am</em>, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read this very short resource on <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/meter.html">Meter and time signatures</a>. (It should be review for most of you.)</li>
<li>Record a video of yourself performing all seven <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicSequentials.html">major-key melodic sequentials</a>. Upload to Google Drive, and share with me. (Feel free to record each sequential one at a time and either splice the videos together or upload multiple files into a single folder, if necessary.)</li>
<li>Record a video of yourself performing rhythmic exercise no. 28 (on p. 21) from the Kazez, with appropriate rhythmic syllables. Upload to GDrive, and share with me.</li>
<li>Also make a 1â€“2 minute video introducing yourself: Who are you? Where are you from? What are your goals? (in life, and in this class) This will help me get to know you better.</li>
</ul>


<p>A 1-minute video domonstrating uploading and sharing files on Google Drive can be found <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/GDrive.html">here</a>. If you have any difficulties, please make use of Piazza to ask questions of me and/or your classmates. CU officially supports GDrive, so the student help desk should also be able to help.</p>

<p>Have a great Labor Day weekend! (In order to enjoy it fully, I highly recommend you complete as much of this assignment as possible by Friday.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions about course materials directly to me, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email <a href="mailto:team@piazza.com">team@piazza.com</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, matters of a private nature should <em>not</em> be addressed on Piazza. Please email me about private concerns, or better yet, come by my office so we can discuss them in person.</p>
