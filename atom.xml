    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For Wednesday&#8217;s class, play through the <a href="http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/media/KBschemata-practiceHandout.pdf">Keyboard voice-leading schemata</a> distributed in class. As you play, try to &#8220;chunk&#8221; these schemata; that is, try to get to the point where you can recognize them as individual patterns, rather than two or three differerent chords put together.</p>

<p>As you play, also try to come up with an explanation for the names assigned to each schema or set of schemata.</p>

<p>Bring the schemata handout and staff paper to class on Wednesday. You will not need Berkowitz or Kazez.</p>

    <id>http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/2013/10/cadence-playlist-analysis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following are the first cadences in each piece of the assigned playlist. If you have any questions, please ask in class or on Piazza.</p>

<p>1) K. 452: 0:27 HC</p>

<p>2) Haydn 105: 0:07 IAC</p>

<p>3) Haydn 89: 0:04 IAC</p>

<p>4) Haydn 105: 0:07 HC</p>

<p>5) K. 283 0:13 PAC</p>

<p>6) K. 545, I.: 0:18 HC</p>

<p>7) K. 545, III.: 0:05 HC</p>

<p>8) K. 550: 0:10 IAC</p>

<p>9) K. 551: 0:08 HC</p>

<p>10) K. 385: 0:05 HC</p>

<p>11) Op. 21: 0:05 HC</p>

<p>12) Op. 2/1: 0:09 HC</p>

<p>13) Haydn 45: 0:16 PAC</p>

<p>Note that the first cadence in a classical piece is far more likely to be a half cadence than any other type. (And keep in mind that I made sure to pick examples that included IACs so that you would have some to practice.) Use this knowledge to guide your listening when given examples from the beginnings of pieces.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I have added two-part dictation exercises to the MUSC 1121 Shared Resources folder on Google Drive. See the PDF in that folder for key, meter, and length information.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday, Sept. 25, will be the Cycle I listening quiz. It will contain the following items, and you will be allowed the number of listenings indicated below for each example:</p>

<ul>
<li>solfège patterns (2 hearings each, first and last pitch provided)</li>
<li>interval ID (2 hearings each)</li>
<li>triad ID (2 hearings each)</li>
<li>rhythmic dictation (4 hearings, with count-off for the meter)</li>
<li>melodic dictation (5 hearings, with a key-establishing cadence and count-off for the meter)</li>
</ul>


<p>To prepare for this quiz, please review your labs and practice any areas that you struggled with (either lots of wrong answers, or too many listenings to get the correct ones). Interval and triad ID are most easily practiced on teoria.com. For melodic dictation, you can use the recorded melodies provided in the <strong>MUSI 1121 shared materials</strong> folder on Google Drive. There are no count-offs or key-establishing cadences, so you may want to provide yourself an extra hearing to get oriented. I have a key for these melodies, so you can stop by my office to review your progress.</p>

<p>Please bring the completed worksheet by my office (slide it under the door if I&#8217;m not around), or take a picture of your completed worksheet and email it to me. Bring the original to class on Monday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Before submitting your assignment, please re-affirm the honor code in writing somewhere on the worksheet:</em></strong></p>

<blockquote><p>I hereby reaffirm the CU honor code. [sign your name]</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, simply,</p>

<blockquote><p>IHRTCUHC. [sign your name]</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, note that this lab will be graded on accuracy (see syllabus). Based on lab 1.1, that should not be a problem, and it will give you a good idea where you stand in advance of Quiz 1 (Sept. 23). (See Cycle I guide for updated schedule.)</p>

<p>Some additional resources may be helpful for you, depending on the state of your understanding of these concepts from written theory. Consult them, as needed. You may consult any informational resources (unless, of course, you happen to come across an answer key) while working on the lab assignment (including re-watching the video), but you may not consult another person as you work out the answers.</p>

    <id>http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/2013/09/new-meeting-3-assignment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Due to technical difficulties, we&#8217;re going to have to scrap Lab 1.1 (for now). Please <strong>disregard</strong> the original Meeting 3 assignment. (I have deleted it in order to reduce confusion.) If necessary, we will push back the Cycle I quiz and/or recitation.</em></p>

<p><strong>For Monday, Sept. 9:</strong></p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://teoria.com">teoria.com</a>, and click on Exercises <a href="https://www.teoria.com/mobile/index.php">&#8220;for mobile devices&#8221;</a>. (Be sure to use the mobile exercises, so you can view/share your score without paying for an account!) The first category is <em>Ear Training</em>. Use both the <a href="https://www.teoria.com/mobile/intervals/ie.php?l=en">Intervals</a> and <a href="https://www.teoria.com/mobile/triads/c3e.php?l=en">Triads</a> modules.</p>

<p>First, practice both interval and triad recognition (root-position triads only: major, minor, diminished, and augmented) until you feel pretty solid. If you are struggling with the intervals, set some limits as you practice. When you first click on &#8220;Intervals Ear Training,&#8221; you see a bunch of check boxes for interval types. By unchecking some of these, you can focus on a subset—just seconds and thirds, for example.</p>

<p><img src="http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills1/images/IntervalPracticeLimits.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If intervals are difficult or new for you, focus on just seconds and thirds, then just fourths and fifths, then thirds and sixths, etc., and finally put them all together once you are comfortable with them in smaller groups.</p>

<p>Once you are starting to get the hang of interval and chord recognition, quiz yourself. Give yourself 10 intervals, and then click &#8220;End exercise and view score.&#8221; Repeat this 10-intervals/chords-at-a-time quiz until you get at least 8 correct. Once you &#8220;pass&#8221; with 8/10 or better, take a screenshot of your result and email it to me. Be sure to reaffirm the honor code in your email. (&#8220;I hereby reaffirm the CU Honor Code&#8221; or &#8220;IHRTCUHC.&#8221;)</p>

<p>If you are having trouble and are unable to reach &#8220;passing&#8221; by Sunday, or are simply spending way too much time trying to get there (more than 30 minutes/day), stop by my office or send me an email describing the specific things that are causing you difficulty.</p>

<p>By Monday, you should send me both <em>passing interval quiz results</em> and <em>passing chord quiz results</em>, or an email in lieu of one (or both) describing your attempts and your difficulties. If you have any questions about this, please email me ASAP or post on Piazza.</p>

<p>Please bring your Berkowitz anthologies to class on Monday.</p>

<p>Sorry again about the mixup! We&#8217;ll get the website fixed/replaced soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For <em>Tuesday, Sept. 3, 8am</em>, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read this very short resource on <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/meter.html">Meter and time signatures</a>. (It should be review for most of you.)</li>
<li>Record a video of yourself performing all seven <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicSequentials.html">major-key melodic sequentials</a>. Upload to Google Drive, and share with me. (Feel free to record each sequential one at a time and either splice the videos together or upload multiple files into a single folder, if necessary.)</li>
<li>Record a video of yourself performing rhythmic exercise no. 28 (on p. 21) from the Kazez, with appropriate rhythmic syllables. Upload to GDrive, and share with me.</li>
<li>Also make a 1–2 minute video introducing yourself: Who are you? Where are you from? What are your goals? (in life, and in this class) This will help me get to know you better.</li>
</ul>


<p>A 1-minute video domonstrating uploading and sharing files on Google Drive can be found <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/GDrive.html">here</a>. If you have any difficulties, please make use of Piazza to ask questions of me and/or your classmates. CU officially supports GDrive, so the student help desk should also be able to help.</p>

<p>Have a great Labor Day weekend! (In order to enjoy it fully, I highly recommend you complete as much of this assignment as possible by Friday.)</p>
